                South India’s largest metropolis was once a desolate sandy strip of land with villages strung along the fabled Coromandel Coast. It rapidly expanded into a settlement, progressed into a town, transformed into a city and today flourishes as a metropolis. Design Hotel Chennai tracks the shades of contemporary India’s aesthetic sense, from sleek minimalism to refined opulence in a setting that epitomizes the synergy of global and local styles.
